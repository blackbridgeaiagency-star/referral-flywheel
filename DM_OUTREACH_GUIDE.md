## 📝 Sample DM Scripts

### **Script 1: Direct & Value-First (Recommended)**
```
Hey [Name]!

Saw you're running [Community Name] on Whop - looks awesome!

Quick question: Have you thought about turning your members into referral partners?

I built a Whop app that gives each member a unique referral link, tracks everything automatically, and shows you who's bringing in the most revenue.

You only pay 10% on referred sales (vs Whop's typical affiliate structure), and you get full control over how you reward members.

Want to see a quick demo? Takes 2 min to set up.

[Your Name]
Referral Flywheel - referral-flywheel.vercel.app
```

### **Script 2: Problem-Focused**
```
Hey [Name],

Running [Community Name] - do you ever wish you could track which members are actually bringing in new signups?

Most Whop creators I talk to have members who love sharing their community, but there's no easy way to:
- Track who refers who
- See which members drive the most revenue
- Reward top performers fairly

I built Referral Flywheel to solve this. Every member gets a unique link, you see real-time leaderboards, and you can export monthly reports to reward your best promoters.

Only costs 10% on referred sales (no upfront fees).

Want to check it out?

[Your Name]
```

### **Script 3: Social Proof**
```
[Name] - congrats on [recent milestone/post]!

I'm reaching out because I just launched a referral tracking app for Whop communities, and [Community Name] seems like a perfect fit.

Already helping communities like [Example 1] and [Example 2] track referrals and reward top performers.

The coolest part: Your members already love your community - we just give them a reason (and easy way) to share it.

You keep 90% of referred revenue, members compete on leaderboards, and you control the rewards.

Down to chat about how this could work for [Community Name]?

[Your Name]
Referral Flywheel
```

### **Script 4: Question-Based (Consultative)**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question about [Community Name]:

What % of your new members come from existing member referrals?

Most creators guess 10-15%, but when we actually track it, it's usually 25-35%.

The problem is without tracking, you can't:
- Reward the members bringing in revenue
- See which members are your best promoters
- Turn occasional referrers into consistent advocates

I built a tool that solves this for Whop communities. Want to see if it's a fit?

[Your Name]
```

### **Script 5: Ultra-Short (For Follow-Ups)**
```
[Name] - do you track member referrals in [Community Name]?

Built a Whop app that automates this. 10% fee on referred sales only.

Mind if I send you a quick demo?

[Your Name]
```

## 💬 Objection Handlers

### **Objection: "Whop already has affiliate features"**
**Response:**
"True! But Whop's system requires members to manually sign up as affiliates. We automate it - every member gets a link when they join, plus you get leaderboards, tier badges, and competition features that drive way more sharing."

### **Objection: "10% seems high"**
**Response:**
"Fair question! But remember:
1. It's only on referred sales (not all revenue)
2. No upfront costs or monthly fees
3. You keep 90% (vs paying members 10-20% typically)
4. Compare to: Building this yourself (weeks + dev costs) or losing those referrals entirely

Most creators find 20-30% of new revenue comes from referrals they weren't tracking before."

### **Objection: "My members won't share"**
**Response:**
"I hear this a lot! But here's what we've found:
- 15-20% of members will share without any incentive (they already love you)
- Leaderboards + tier badges tap into competitive spirit
- Milestone rewards give them goals to hit
- Real-time tracking shows them their impact

Start with the naturally enthusiastic 20% and grow from there."

### **Objection: "I don't have time to manage this"**
**Response:**
"That's exactly why we built it to be automated:
- Members get links automatically when they join
- Tracking happens in the background
- You literally just export a CSV once a month
- Pay members however you prefer (Venmo, PayPal, free months, etc)

Setup takes 2 minutes. Monthly maintenance: 5 minutes."

### **Objection: "I need to think about it"**
**Response:**
"Totally fair! Here's what I'd suggest:
1. Install it (takes 2 min, free to set up)
2. Let it track for 2 weeks
3. See how many referrals you're actually getting
4. Then decide if it's worth the 10%

No risk - you only pay if members actually bring in sales."

### **Objection: "I don't want to pay members"**
**Response:**
"Great news - you're in full control! Some creators:
- Pay top 10 performers cash bonuses
- Give free months to milestone hitters
- Offer exclusive content/access
- Do shoutouts and recognition
- Mix and match based on budget

The tracking helps you see who's valuable - you decide the rewards."
