# 5. Redeploy:
vercel --prod
```

**Time**: 10 minutes

### 3. Update Whop Webhook URL (Required for Webhooks)

**Why**: Enable payment processing and member tracking
**Steps**:

1. Go to: https://whop.com/dashboard/developer
2. Select your app: `app_xa1a8NaAKUVPuO`
3. Update webhook URL to:
   ```

# Expected: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}

# Test database
curl https://referral-flywheel-nlfx0mupr-blackbridges-projects.vercel.app/api/debug/db-test
# Expected: Database connection successful
```

**Browser Tests**:
