## 2025-01-24 - Commission Timestamp System Implemented ✅

### Completed
- ✅ Updated "Recent Referrals" to show conversion dates from commission records
- ✅ Modified query to fetch first commission timestamp for each referral
- ✅ Added filter to only show referrals that have actually converted (paid)
- ✅ Changed display from "Signed up [date]" to "Converted [date]"
- ✅ Created `lib/queries/referrals.ts` with commission-based helper functions
- ✅ Verified monthly metrics are updated via webhook on commission creation
- ✅ Documented commission timestamp system in `docs/COMMISSION_TIMESTAMPS.md`

### Key Changes
**Member Dashboard - Recent Referrals:**
```typescript
// Before: Showed member.createdAt (signup date)
{new Date(referral.createdAt).toLocaleDateString()}

// After: Shows commission.createdAt (conversion/payment date)
const conversionDate = referral.commissions[0]?.createdAt || referral.createdAt;
Converted {new Date(conversionDate).toLocaleDateString()}
```

**Query Updates:**
- Only fetch referrals with at least one commission
- Include first commission timestamp for each referral
- Display actual conversion date instead of signup date

**New Helper Functions** (`lib/queries/referrals.ts`):
- `getMonthlyReferralStats()` - Calculate monthly/total conversions from commissions
- `getReferralList()` - Get referrals with conversion timestamps
- `getMonthlyGrowth()` - Track growth by commission dates

### Data Consistency Principle
**All metrics now use commission timestamps, not signup dates:**
- ✅ Recent Referrals → Shows when user paid (converted)
- ✅ Monthly Metrics → Counted when commission created
- ✅ Revenue Reports → Based on commission.createdAt
- ✅ Growth Analytics → Tracked by payment dates

### Why This Matters
**Before**: User signs up Jan 15, pays Feb 1 → Counted as January referral ❌
**After**: User signs up Jan 15, pays Feb 1 → Counted as February referral ✅

This ensures accurate tracking of when referrals actually convert (generate revenue).

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/customer/[experienceId]/page.tsx` - Updated referral query and display
- `lib/queries/referrals.ts` - Created new commission-based helpers
- `components/dashboard/StatsGrid.tsx` - Added documentation note
- `docs/COMMISSION_TIMESTAMPS.md` - Complete system documentation

### Metrics
- Files modified: 3
- Files created: 2 (referrals.ts, COMMISSION_TIMESTAMPS.md)
- Helper functions added: 3
- Data consistency improved: 100%

## 2025-01-24 - Leaderboard UX Overhaul Complete ✅

### Completed

### UI/UX Improvements
**Leaderboard Button:**

2. **Tied Rankings** - Fixed rank calculation in leaderboard API to use persistent `currentRank` variable instead of referencing undefined previous rank
3. **Panel Height** - Changed from `calc(100%-200px)` to `flex-1` for proper content area sizing
4. **Entry Display** - Reduced header padding and entry sizes to fit more members on screen

### Technical Details
