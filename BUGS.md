### BUG-001: Webhook Handler Undefined Data (2025-01-27)
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Resolved

**Description**:
Webhook handler was failing when test webhooks didn't have email or user_id fields, causing undefined errors in generateReferralCode function.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Send test webhook without email field
2. Webhook handler tries to split undefined email
3. Application crashes

**Expected Behavior**:
Webhook should handle missing fields gracefully with fallbacks.

**Actual Behavior**:
Application crashed with undefined error.

**Root Cause**:
No safety checks for missing webhook data fields.

**Fix**:
Added safety checks and fallbacks:
- email: data.email || 'test@example.com'
- userId: data.user_id || `test_${Date.now()}`
- nameForCode: Safe fallback logic for referral code generation

**Prevention**:
Always add safety checks for external API data.
