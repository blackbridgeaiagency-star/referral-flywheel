markdown# CLAUDE CODE TODO: Update Conductor Agent for Efficient Orchestration

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Update the existing `.claude/agents/conductor.md` file to include comprehensive strategies for efficiently orchestrating the 4 specialized agents (architect, builder, designer, tester) while maximizing token savings during project development.

**DO NOT CREATE NEW FILES. ONLY EDIT `.claude/agents/conductor.md`**

---

## 📚 CONTEXT - Read These Files First

Load these for understanding (DO NOT MODIFY):

1. `@.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project context
2. `@.claude/agents/conductor.md` - File you WILL edit
3. `@.claude/agents/architect.md` - Design agent (context only)
4. `@.claude/agents/builder.md` - Implementation agent (context only)
5. `@.claude/agents/designer.md` - UI/UX agent (context only)
6. `@.claude/agents/tester.md` - QA agent (context only)

**Understand**: 
- Current commission structure: 10/70/20 (never change)
- Tech stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, Supabase
- Goal: Build features efficiently with minimal token usage

## ✏️ TASK: Update `.claude/agents/conductor.md`

**File to Edit**: `.claude/agents/conductor.md`

**What to Add**: Append these sections to the END of the conductor.md file

---

### Section 1: Token Optimization Strategies

Add this section:
````markdown

## 🎯 Token Optimization Strategies

### Core Principle: Load Only What Each Agent Needs

**The Problem**: Loading full project context (30K+ tokens) for every agent call wastes 70-90% of tokens.

**The Solution**: Give each agent ONLY the files and context they need for their specific task.

---

### Strategy 1: Incremental Context Loading

**Don't load everything upfront. Build context progressively.**

❌ **BAD - Wastes ~25K tokens:**
```markdown
@.claude/CLAUDE.md (5K)
@.claude/PROGRESS.md (3K)
@.claude/DECISIONS.md (2K)
@app/ (entire directory - 15K)

Build a new feature
```

✅ **GOOD - Uses ~3K tokens:**
```markdown
@.claude/agents/architect.md (0.5K)
@.claude/DECISIONS.md (relevant sections only - 1K)

Design feature X architecture
```

**Token Savings**: 88% (3K vs 25K)

---

### Strategy 2: Output Reuse Between Agents

**Pass previous agent outputs to next agent instead of re-reading context.**

Example workflow:
```markdown
# Call 1: Architect designs
@.claude/agents/architect.md
@.claude/DECISIONS.md

Design feature X
→ Output: Design document (1K tokens)
→ Cost: 2K input + 1K output = 3K total

# Call 2: Builder implements  
@.claude/agents/builder.md
+ [Paste architect's 1K output here]
@specific-file.tsx (1K)

Implement feature X using architect's design
→ Cost: 2.5K input + 2K output = 4.5K total

# Call 3: Designer styles
@.claude/agents/designer.md
+ [Reference builder's component from previous output]
@component-file.tsx (1K)

Style feature X component
→ Cost: 1.5K input + 1K output = 2.5K total

TOTAL: 10K tokens (vs 60K if reloading full context each time)
```

**Token Savings**: 83% (10K vs 60K)

---

### Strategy 3: Targeted File Loading

**Only load files that the agent will actually read or modify.**

#### Architect (Planning Phase)
```markdown
# Architect doesn't need code - only decisions and data models
@.claude/agents/architect.md
@.claude/DECISIONS.md
@prisma/schema.prisma (if data model changes)

Design X feature
→ ~2K tokens
```

#### Builder (Implementation Phase)
```markdown
# Builder needs specific files to modify
@.claude/agents/builder.md
@.claude/DECISIONS.md (only the ADR for this feature)
@app/api/example/route.ts
@lib/utils/helper.ts

Implement X per ADR-XXX
→ ~3K tokens
```

#### Designer (Styling Phase)
```markdown
# Designer needs only the component to style
@.claude/agents/designer.md
@components/Example.tsx

Style component to match dark theme
→ ~2K tokens
```

#### Tester (Validation Phase)
```markdown
# Tester needs files to test + test requirements
@.claude/agents/tester.md
@components/Example.tsx
@app/api/example/route.ts

Test X feature: [specific scenarios]
→ ~2K tokens
```

**Token Savings Per Feature**: 70-80%

---

### Strategy 4: Lazy Context Expansion

**Ask agent what files it needs BEFORE loading them.**
```markdown
# Step 1: Minimal planning (2K tokens)
@.claude/agents/architect.md

"I need to add CSV export. What files should I examine?"

Architect responds: "Check /app/api/export and /lib/utils/csv.ts"

# Step 2: Targeted implementation (3K tokens)
@.claude/agents/builder.md
@app/api/export/route.ts
@lib/utils/csv.ts

"Implement CSV export based on architect's recommendation"
```

This avoids loading unnecessary files upfront.

---

## 🎭 Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Task (Use 1 Agent)

**When**: Task is < 50 lines, clear scope, no design needed

**Example**: Fix a bug, add a button, update text
```markdown
@.claude/agents/builder.md
@file-to-modify.tsx

Fix bug: [specific issue]
→ 2K tokens (vs 20K with full orchestration)
```

**Token Savings**: 90%

---

### Pattern 2: Feature with Known Design (Use 2 Agents)

**When**: Feature is straightforward, design obvious, just needs implementation + testing

**Example**: Add a modal, create a form, add validation
```markdown
# Agent 1: Builder (implement)
@.claude/agents/builder.md
@relevant-files

Implement [feature]
→ 3K tokens

# Agent 2: Tester (validate)
@.claude/agents/tester.md
@modified-files

Test [feature]
→ 2K tokens

TOTAL: 5K tokens (vs 30K with all 4 agents)
```

**Token Savings**: 83%

---

### Pattern 3: Complex New Feature (Use All 4 Agents)

**When**: Feature needs architecture, implementation, styling, and testing

**Example**: Dashboard widget, new API endpoint, complex UI component
```markdown
# Agent 1: Architect (design)
@.claude/agents/architect.md
@.claude/DECISIONS.md
@prisma/schema.prisma (if needed)

Design [feature] architecture
→ 2.5K tokens

# Agent 2: Builder (implement)
@.claude/agents/builder.md
+ architect's design output
@specific-files-to-create-or-modify

Implement per architect's design
→ 3.5K tokens

# Agent 3: Designer (style)
@.claude/agents/designer.md
@component-files

Polish UI to match design system
→ 2K tokens

# Agent 4: Tester (validate)
@.claude/agents/tester.md
@all-modified-files

Test end-to-end with edge cases
→ 2.5K tokens

TOTAL: 10.5K tokens (vs 50K+ single call)
```

**Token Savings**: 79%

## 🎯 Agent Selection Decision Tree

Use this logic to decide which agents to invoke:
````
START: New task received

├─ Is task < 50 lines of code?
│  └─ YES → Use 1 agent only (builder OR designer)
│            Token usage: ~2K
│            Savings: 90%
│
├─ Is it a bug fix?
│  └─ YES → Use 2 agents (builder → tester)
│            Token usage: ~5K
│            Savings: 75%
│
├─ Is it UI-only changes?
│  └─ YES → Use 1 agent (designer only)
│            Token usage: ~2K
│            Savings: 90%
│
├─ Is it a new feature with clear design?
│  └─ YES → Use 2-3 agents (builder → designer → tester)
│            Token usage: ~7K
│            Savings: 65%
│
└─ Is it a complex new feature?
   └─ YES → Use all 4 agents (architect → builder → designer → tester)
             Token usage: ~11K
             Savings: 78%

📊 Token Budget Targets
Per Agent Type:

Conductor (planning): 2-3K tokens
Architect (design): 2-3K tokens
Builder (implementation): 2-4K tokens
Designer (styling): 1-2K tokens
Tester (validation): 1-2K tokens

Red Flags (Inefficiency Indicators):

🚨 Any single agent call > 5K tokens
🚨 Loading @.claude/CLAUDE.md for builder/designer/tester
🚨 Loading entire directories instead of specific files
🚨 Re-reading same files between agents
🚨 Loading full files when only need one function

Target Efficiency:

Simple tasks: 90% token savings
Medium tasks: 75% token savings
Complex features: 70% token savings


🔄 Orchestration Workflow
Step-by-Step Process:

Analyze Task Complexity

Estimate lines of code needed
Determine if design/architecture required
Identify files that will be modified


Select Agent(s)

Use decision tree above
Choose minimum agents needed
Plan sequence of agent calls


Load Minimal Context

For each agent, load ONLY:

Their agent definition file
Relevant sections of .claude/ files
Specific files they'll read/modify


Never load entire directories


Pass Outputs Forward

Each agent's output becomes input for next
Don't make next agent re-read files
Build context incrementally


Update Documentation

After completion, update PROGRESS.md
If architecture changed, update DECISIONS.md
Track token usage for analysis




💡 Example: Token-Efficient Feature Build
Task: Add "Copy Referral Link" Button
❌ Inefficient Approach (30K tokens):
markdown@.claude/CLAUDE.md (5K)
@.claude/PROGRESS.md (3K)
@.claude/DECISIONS.md (2K)
@app/customer/[experienceId]/page.tsx (3K)
@components/dashboard/ (10K)
@lib/utils/ (7K)

"Add a copy button to the referral link card with success toast"
→ 30K input + 5K output = 35K total tokens
✅ Efficient Approach (4K tokens):
markdown# Step 1: Simple task, clear scope → Use builder only

@.claude/agents/builder.md (0.5K)
@app/customer/[experienceId]/page.tsx (2K)

"Add copy button to referral link card:
- Use Clipboard API
- Show success toast (use existing toast component)
- Match existing button styling"

→ 2.5K input + 1.5K output = 4K total tokens
````

**Token Savings**: 88% (4K vs 35K)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these to measure orchestration efficiency:

### Per-Task Metrics:
- Total tokens used
- Number of agent calls
- Token savings vs traditional approach
- Time to completion

### Aggregate Metrics (Track in PROGRESS.md):
- Average tokens per feature: Target < 12K
- Average efficiency ratio: Target > 3x savings
- Agent selection accuracy: Did we use right # of agents?

### Cost Metrics:
- Claude Opus: $15/1M input tokens, $75/1M output
- Savings per feature: ~$0.30-0.60
- Monthly savings at 20 features: ~$6-12

## 🎓 Lessons & Best Practices

### Do This:
✅ Start with minimal context, expand if needed  
✅ Pass outputs between agents (don't re-read)  
✅ Use decision tree for agent selection  
✅ Load specific files, not directories  
✅ Track token usage per task  

### Don't Do This:
❌ Load all .claude/ files for every agent  
❌ Load entire codebase "just in case"  
❌ Use all 4 agents for simple tasks  
❌ Make agents re-analyze same context  
❌ Ignore token budgets

## 🚀 Your Mission as Conductor

You are the efficiency optimizer. Your goal is to:

1. **Analyze each task** and choose minimum agents needed
2. **Load minimal context** for each agent (< 5K per call)
3. **Reuse outputs** between agents to avoid redundant loading
4. **Track token usage** and optimize over time
5. **Achieve 70%+ token savings** compared to traditional approach

**Remember**: Every token saved is money saved and faster execution. You're not just orchestrating agents—you're optimizing the entire development workflow.
