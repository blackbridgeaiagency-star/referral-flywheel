### What is my referral code?

## Earning Commissions

### How much do I earn per referral?
You earn **10% of every payment** your referrals make, for as long as they remain a member. This is a lifetime commission.

**Example:**
- Your friend joins at $49.99/month
- You earn $4.99/month forever
- After 12 months: $59.88
- After 24 months: $119.76

### When do I get paid?
Commissions are paid out monthly, typically on the 15th of each month for the previous month's earnings.

### Is there a minimum payout?
Yes, the minimum payout threshold is $10. If you earn less than $10 in a month, it rolls over to the next month.

### How do I track my earnings?
- Visit your dashboard
- View the "Earnings" tab

- Check the earnings chart for trends

## Sharing Your Link

### Can I use paid ads?
Yes, but check with the creator first. Some communities have policies about paid advertising.

### What if someone doesn't use my link?
If they purchase without your link, you won't earn commission. Make sure they click your link **before** purchasing.

## Referral Tracking

Once someone clicks your link, you have **30 days** to convert them. If they purchase within 30 days, you get credit.

### What if two people share links to the same person?
The last clicked link within 30 days gets credit. If Person A shares today and Person B shares tomorrow, Person B gets credit if they purchase.
