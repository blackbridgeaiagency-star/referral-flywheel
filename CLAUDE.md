# Referral Flywheel - Master Context
*Last Updated: 2025-01-27*

## üéØ Project Mission
Build a viral growth engine for Whop communities. Every member becomes an automatic affiliate earning 10% lifetime commissions. Creators get 70%, platform gets 20%.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
```yaml
Framework: Next.js 14.0.4 (App Router, React Server Components)
Language: TypeScript 5+ (strict mode)
Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ + shadcn/ui
Database: PostgreSQL 15 (Supabase)
ORM: Prisma 5.7.1
Auth: Whop SDK (messaging temporarily disabled)
Deployment: Vercel
```

### Database Schema (4 Tables)
```prisma
Creator       ‚Üí Whop community owners, reward settings
Member        ‚Üí Users with unique referral codes (FIRSTNAME-ABC123)
AttributionClick ‚Üí 30-day tracking window, fingerprint-based
Commission    ‚Üí Payment records with 10/70/20 split
```

### Critical Business Rules
**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER MODIFY THESE:**
- Member commission: 10% (lifetime recurring)
- Creator commission: 70%
- Platform commission: 20%
- Attribution window: 30 days
- Referral code format: FIRSTNAME-ABC123

## ‚úÖ Current State (Production Ready)

- [x] Prisma client configured
- [x] All utility functions (referral code, commission calc, attribution, fingerprint)
- [x] Webhook handler with safety checks for test webhooks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

## üéØ Next Priorities
1. Run database migrations (`prisma db push`)
2. Configure environment variables
3. Test webhook flow end-to-end
4. Deploy to production
